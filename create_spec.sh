Without this, subsequent advanced topics would lack context.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reading the initial chapters covering Weeks 1-6 of the course outline. A reader should be able to articulate the purpose and basic workflow of each core system (ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim, etc.) and their interconnections in the end-to-end Physical AI pipeline. This delivers foundational knowledge essential for anyone entering the field.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1.  **Given** a reader with basic programming knowledge, **When** they complete chapters covering Weeks 1-6, **Then** they can describe the overall Physical AI pipeline from simulation to deployment.\n2.  **Given** a reader wants to understand ROS 2 fundamentals, **When** they read the relevant chapter, **Then** they can explain the core components of ROS 2 (nodes, topics, services, parameters) and their application in robotics.\n3.  **Given** a reader wants to understand simulation environments, **When** they read the relevant chapters, **Then** they can differentiate between Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim and identify their respective strengths in Physical AI development.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Implementing Perception and Planning (Priority: P1)\n\nAn AI developer or robotics engineer wants to learn how to integrate perception systems (e.g., Vision-Language-Action, Isaac ROS, Whisper) and planning frameworks (e.g., Nav2, GPT-based reasoning) into embodied AI systems, bridging digital AI with physical robots.\n\n**Why this priority**: This story addresses the practical application of advanced AI techniques in robotics, which is a primary focus of the book and crucial for developing autonomous humanoid capabilities.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reading chapters covering perception and planning modules (e.g., Weeks 7-10). A reader should be able to conceptually design a perception pipeline using mentioned tools and outline a planning strategy for a robot, demonstrating how data flows from sensors to intelligent decision-making. This delivers practical guidance for building intelligent robot behaviors.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1.  **Given** a reader understands core Physical AI concepts, **When** they complete chapters on perception (e.g., VLA, Isaac ROS), **Then** they can explain how sensor data is processed for environmental understanding.\n2.  **Given** a reader understands perception, **When** they complete chapters on planning (e.g., Nav2, GPT-based reasoning), **Then** they can articulate how high-level goals are translated into robot actions.\n3.  **Given** a reader is interested in Vision-Language-Action models, **When** they read the dedicated section, **Then** they can describe the principles behind VLA and its application in humanoid robotics.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Developing and Deploying Autonomous Humanoids (Priority: P2)\n\nAn advanced student or engineer aims to grasp the end-to-end process of building an autonomous humanoid, from voice command processing and high-level planning to navigation, object identification, and manipulation, culminating in a capstone project.\n\n**Why this priority**: This story represents the advanced synthesis of all prior knowledge into a complex, real-world application, directly aligning with the book's capstone project and providing a comprehensive learning experience.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reading the capstone project definition and related chapters (e.g., Weeks 11-13). A reader should be able to draw an architectural diagram of the Autonomous Humanoid Capstone, detailing the flow from voice input to physical manipulation, and identify the key technologies involved at each stage. This delivers a holistic understanding of humanoid robot development.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1.  **Given** a reader has completed the core and intermediate modules, **When** they review the Capstone project details, **Then** they can describe the full pipeline for an autonomous humanoid responding to voice commands.\n2.  **Given** a reader wants to understand hardware requirements, **When** they read the hardware section, **Then** they can identify the necessary specifications for building a physical AI platform.\n3.  **Given** a reader wants to deploy a physical AI system, **When** they read the deployment considerations, **Then** they can identify key steps and challenges in moving from simulation to real-world operation.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when a core system (e.g., ROS 2, Gazebo) has an update that changes API behavior?\n- How does the book handle discrepancies between simulation and real-world robot behavior?\n- What if the recommended hardware becomes obsolete or unavailable?\n- How are security considerations (e.g., data privacy for VLA models, physical security of robots) addressed?\n- What happens when a reader's existing system (e.g., Ubuntu version, ROS 2 distribution) does not exactly match the book's target environment?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: The book MUST provide comprehensive coverage of all modules and weekly breakdowns from a 13-week course on Physical AI.\n- **FR-002**: The book MUST explain the core systems: ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2, Whisper, and GPT-based reasoning.\n- **FR-003**: The book MUST include a minimum of 15 diagrams illustrating architecture, pipelines, sensor flows, and robot URDF/TF trees.\n- **FR-004**: The book MUST provide sample ROS 2 code, launch files, and minimal reproducible examples for key concepts.\n- **FR-005**: The book MUST describe up-to-date and accurate hardware requirements for Physical AI development.\n- **FR-006**: The book MUST define the complete Capstone project: an Autonomous Humanoid capable of Voice → Plan → Navigate → Identify → Manipulate.\n- **FR-007**: The book MUST be formatted in Markdown, ready for Docusaurus GitHub Pages deployment, including appropriate frontmatter.\n- **FR-008**: The book MUST contain a minimum of 12 chapters, mapped to course modules.\n- **FR-009**: All technical claims in the book MUST be aligned with official ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac documentation.\n- **FR-010**: All code examples in the book MUST target Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble or Iron.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Book**: A collection of chapters, diagrams, code examples, and a capstone project, formatted for Docusaurus.\n- **Chapter**: A structured section of the book, covering specific Physical AI concepts or tools, mapped to course modules.\n- **Diagram**: A visual representation of architectural components, data flows, or robot structures.\n- **Code Example**: Snippets or full files illustrating ROS 2 nodes, launch files, or other relevant code.\n- **Capstone Project**: The culminating autonomous humanoid project, detailed with its stages and requirements.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: The generated book content successfully compiles and displays correctly when deployed via Docusaurus GitHub Pages.\n- **SC-002**: The book contains at least 12 distinct chapters, each clearly addressing a specific course module or concept.\n- **SC-003**: The book includes at least 15 diagrams that accurately depict architectural and robotic concepts as specified.\n- **SC-004**: All sample code provided within the book successfully executes on an Ubuntu 22.04 system with ROS 2 Humble or Iron installed.\n- **SC-005**: The Capstone project description is complete and clear enough for a reader to understand the full Voice → Plan → Navigate → Identify → Manipulate pipeline of the autonomous humanoid.\n- **SC-006**: Technical claims, when cross-referenced with official documentation, are consistently accurate.\n- **SC-007**: The book is generatable and iterative within a 3-day hackathon period, allowing for rapid content updates.\n- **SC-008**: The book effectively bridges digital AI (LLMs, perception, simulation) with embodied systems (humanoids, sensors, locomotion), as evidenced by review.\n_END_OF_SPEC_
