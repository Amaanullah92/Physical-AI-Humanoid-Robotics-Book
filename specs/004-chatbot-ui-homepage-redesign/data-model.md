# Data Model: Chatbot UI Enhancements and Docusaurus Homepage Redesign

This document confirms that the existing data model from the primary RAG Chatbot feature (`specs/002-rag-chatbot-book/data-model.md`) remains unchanged for this feature, which focuses on UI enhancements and homepage redesign. No new core entities are introduced.

## 1. Qdrant Collection: `physical_ai_book`

The structure of the `physical_ai_book` Qdrant collection, including its vector parameters and payload schema, remains as defined in `specs/002-rag-chatbot-book/data-model.md`.

## 2. API Data Structures

The request and response bodies for the `/query` and `/ingest` endpoints, as well as the `Source` object, remain as defined in `specs/002-rag-chatbot-book/data-model.md` and `specs/002-rag-chatbot-book/contracts/openapi.yaml`.

## 3. No New Entities

This feature does not introduce any new data entities or modifications to existing data entity structures. The focus is on improving the user interface and presentation.
